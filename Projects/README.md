# 📚 Wellcome to the Projects section

## What's inside?  

- 📊 This portfolio includes some of the projects I've worked on, showcasing my skills as a data scientist.
- ♻️ This repository is always under construction, so I will be adding more projects in the future.
- 🎓 I learned a lot from each project I completed, so I hope you enjoy them as much as I did :).


## Projects  

### 1. **Fetal Health Classification**  

Reducing child mortality is a crucial goal outlined in several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.

In this project, I explore the use of Supervided Classification Machine Learning Algorithms (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and KNN) to binary clasify the fetal state.
