# 📚 Welcome to the Projects section

🚧 As I continue learning and refining my skills, this repository is a work in progress, so I am constantly adding updates and new projects! 🚀

## What's inside?  

- 📊 This portfolio includes some of the projects I've worked on, showcasing my skills as a Data Scientist.
- 🎓 I learned a lot from each project, so I hope you enjoy them as much as I did :).


## Projects  

### 1. 👶🏻🩺 **Fetal Health Prediction During Childbirth**  

Reducing child mortality is a crucial goal outlined in several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. During childbirth, it is possible to monitor the baby's health to try to diagnose their health condition.

In this project, I explore the use of Supervised Classification Machine Learning Algorithms (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbors) to predict the Fetal Health State during childbirth.

| Project Link | Completion Date | ML Algorithms |Key Steps 
|---|---|---|---|
|👶🏻🩺 [Fetal Health Classification](https://github.com/mjimenezj/Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Project_1/README.md)| Feb, 2025 | - Naive Bayes <br> - Support Vector Machine (SVM) <br> - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  | 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): univariate and multivariate. <br> 2. Outliers detection (IQR, Z-score) & Treatement. <br> 3. Splitting the Dataset. <br> 4. Feature scaling. <br> 5. Coarse-to-Fine Hyperparameter Tuning Search. <br> 6. Models Training. <br> 7. Validation Report: ROC-AUC, Accuracy, F1-score, PR-AUC, etc. |

### 2. 🔬🧬 *De novo* Protein Design - Binder 

Currently I am working on a project to design the binder of a protein using Deep Learning Diffusion Methods:

🚧🚧🚧 I expect to have the project ready by 📌 March 15th, 2025. 🚧🚧🚧

| Project Link | Completion Date | Software |Key Steps 
|---|---|---|---|
| 🔬🧬 *De novo* Protein Design | 🚧 Mar, 2025 🚧 | - RosettaFold Difussion <br> - Portein MPNN <br> - AlphaFold 3 <br> - Linux  | soon|

### Future projects

📌 Apr 2025: Design and implementation of infrastructure automation on AWS.

📌 May 2025: Development of a data ingestion and analysis application using Hadoop and Spark.
