## What's inside?  

This portfolio includes carefully selected projects that demonstrate my skills and contributions in the following areas:  
- **Protein design:** ML-driven tools for predicting and optimizing protein sequences with desired properties.  
- **Drug discovery:** Models to predict pharmacological properties, prioritize compounds, and accelerate drug development pipelines.  
- **Reproducible workflows:** All projects are documented and designed to be easily understood and replicated.  

## Projects  

### 1. **Protein Sequence Optimization with Generative Models**  

In this notebook, I explore the use of generative models (e.g., Variational Autoencoders, GANs) to optimize protein sequences for enhanced stability and activity. Using public datasets like UniProt, I demonstrate how deep learning can drive rational protein design.

### 2. **Binding Affinity Prediction for Drug Candidates**  
A supervised ML approach to predict protein-ligand binding affinity using regression models. This project leverages the PDBbind dataset and includes an evaluation of models such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
