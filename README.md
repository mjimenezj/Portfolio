Hello, I'm Marcos. I am a passionate scientist with more than 5 years of research experience recently graduated as PhD in Biochemistry. 

My research has awakened my interest in the world of Data Science. I am currently enrolled in an online MSc in Data Science and I want to share some of the projects I am working on here. I hope you enjoy reading the projects as much as I did creating them :).
