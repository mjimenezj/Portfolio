Hello, I'm Marcos. I am a passionate scientist with more than 5 years of research experience, recently graduated as PhD in Biochemistry. 

My research has awakened my interest in the world of Data Science. I am making a transition from Experimental Sciences to Data Science. To boost my technical skills, I am currently enrolled in an MSc in Data Science & Big Data (online), and I want to share some of the projects I am working on here. I hope you enjoy reading the projects as much as I did creating them :).
